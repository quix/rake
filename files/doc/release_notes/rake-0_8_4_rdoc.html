                <h1><a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> 0.8.4 Released</h1>
                <p>
                <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> version 0.8.4 is a bug-fix
                release of rake.
                </p>
                <p>
                NOTE: The version of <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> that
                comes with Ruby 1.9 has diverged
                </p>
                <pre>slightly from the core Rake code base.  Rake 0.8.4 will work&#x000A;with Ruby 1.9, but is not a strict upgrade for the Rake that&#x000A;comes with Ruby 1.9.  A (near) future release of Rake will unify&#x000A;those two codebases.</pre>
                <h2>Letter Writing Campaign</h2>
                <p>
                Thanks to Aaron Patterson (@tenderlove) and Eric Hodel (@drbrain) for their
                encouraging support in organizing a letter writing campaign to lobby for
                the &#8220;Warning Free&#8221; release of rake 0.8.4.  A special callout
                goes to Jonathan D. Lord, Sr (Dr. Wingnut) whose postcard was the first to
                actually reach me. (see <a

                <h2>What is <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a></h2>
                <p>
                <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> is a build tool similar to
                the make program in many ways. But instead of cryptic make recipes, <a
                href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> uses standard Ruby code to
                declare tasks and dependencies. You have the full power of a modern
                scripting language built right into your build tool.
                </p>
                <h2>Availability</h2>
                <p>
                The easiest way to get and install rake is via RubyGems &#8230;
                </p>
                <pre>gem install rake    (you may need root/admin privileges)</pre>
                <p>
                Otherwise, you can get it from the more traditional places:

                </table>
                <h2>Task Argument Examples</h2>
                <p>
                Prior to version 0.8.0, rake was only able to handle command line arguments
                of the form NAME=VALUE that were passed into <a
                href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> via the ENV hash.  Many folks
                had asked for some kind of simple command line arguments, perhaps using
                &#8220;&#8212;&#8221; to separate regular task names from argument values
                on the command line.  The problem is that there was no easy way to
                associate positional arguments on the command line with different tasks. 
                Suppose both tasks :a and :b expect a command line argument: does the first
                value go with :a?  What if :b is run first? Should it then get the first
                command line argument.
                </p>
                <p>
                <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> 0.8.0 solves this problem by
                explicitly passing values directly to the tasks that need them.  For
                example, if I had a release task that required a version number, I could
                say:
                </p>
                <pre>rake release[0.8.4]</pre>
                <p>
                And the string &#8220;0.8.4&#8220; will be passed to the :release task. 
                Multiple arguments can be passed by separating them with a comma, for
                example:
                </p>
                <pre>rake name[john,doe]</pre>
                <p>
                Just a few words of caution.  The rake task name and its arguments need to
                be a single command line argument to rake.  This generally means no spaces.
                If spaces are needed, then the entire rake + argument string should be
                quoted.  Something like this:
                </p>
                <pre>rake &quot;name[billy bob, smith]&quot;</pre>
                <p>
                (Quoting rules vary between operating systems and shells, so make sure you
                consult the proper docs for your OS/shell).
                </p>
                <h3>Tasks that Expect Parameters</h3>
                <p>
                Parameters are only given to tasks that are setup to expect them.  In order
                to handle named parameters, the task declaration syntax for tasks has been
                extended slightly.
                </p>
                <p>
                For example, a task that needs a first name and last name might be declared
                as:
                </p>
                <pre>task :name, :first_name, :last_name</pre>
                <p>
                The first argument is still the name of the task (:name in this case). The
                next to argumements are the names of the parameters expected by :name
                (:first_name and :last_name in the example).
                </p>
                <p>
                To access the values of the paramters, the block defining the task
                behaviour can now accept a second parameter:
                </p>
                <pre>task :name, :first_name, :last_name do |t, args|&#x000A;  puts &quot;First name is #{args.first_name}&quot;&#x000A;  puts &quot;Last  name is #{args.last_name}&quot;&#x000A;end</pre>
                <p>
                The first argument of the block &#8220;t&#8221; is always bound to the
                current task object.  The second argument &#8220;args&#8221; is an
                open-struct like object that allows access to the task arguments.  Extra
                command line arguments to a task are ignored.  Missing command line
                arguments are given the nil value.
                </p>
