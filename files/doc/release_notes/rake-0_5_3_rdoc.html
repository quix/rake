                <h1><a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> 0.5.0 Released</h1>
                <p>
                Although it has only been two weeks since the last release, we have enough
                updates to the <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> program to
                make it time for another release.
                </p>
                <h2>Changes</h2>
                <p>
                Here are the changes for version 0.5.3 &#8230;
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li><p>
                FileLists have been extensively changed so that they mimic the behavior of
                real arrays even more closely.  In particular, operations on FileLists that
                return a new collection (e.g. collect, reject) will now return a <a
                href="../../../classes/Rake/FileList.html">FileList</a> rather than an
                array.  In addition, several places where FileLists were not properly
                expanded before use have been fixed.
                </p>
                </li>
                <li><p>
                A method (<tt>ext</tt>) to simplify the handling of file extensions was
                added to <a href="../../../classes/String.html">String</a> and to Array.
                </p>
                </li>
                <li><p>
                The &#8216;testrb&#8217; script in test/unit tends to silently swallow
                syntax errors in test suites.  Because of that, the default test loader is
                now a rake-provided script.  You can still use &#8216;testrb&#8217; by
                setting the loader flag in the test task to :testrb.  (See the API
                documents for TestTask for all the loader flag values).
                </p>
                </li>
                <li><p>
                FileUtil methods (e.g. cp, mv, install) are now declared to be private. 
                This will cut down on the interference with user defined methods of the
                same name.
                </p>
                </li>
                <li><p>
                Fixed the verbose flag in the TestTask so that the test code is controlled
                by the flag.  Also shortened up some failure messages. (Thanks to Tobias
                Luetke for the suggestion).
                </p>
                </li>
                <li><p>
                Rules will now properly detect a task that can generate a source file. 
                Previously rules would only consider source files that were already
                present.
                </p>
                </li>
                <li><p>
                Added an <tt>import</tt> command that allows <a
                href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> to dynamically import
                dependendencies into a running <a
                href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> session.  The <tt>import</tt>
                command can run tasks to update the dependency file before loading them.
                Dependency files can be in rake or make format, allowing rake to work with
                tools designed to generate dependencies for make.
                </p>
                </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>What is <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a></h2>
                <p>
                <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> is a build tool similar to
                the make program in many ways.  But instead of cryptic make recipes, <a
                href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> uses standard Ruby code to
                declare tasks and dependencies.  You have the full power of a modern
                scripting language built right into your build tool.
                </p>
                <h2>Availability</h2>
                <p>
                The easiest way to get and install rake is via RubyGems &#8230;
                </p>
                <pre>gem install rake    (you may need root/admin privileges)</pre>
                <p>
                Otherwise, you can get it from the more traditional places:

                <p>
                As usual, it was input from users that drove a alot of these changes.
                Thanks to &#8230;

                Brian Gernhardt for the rules fix (especially for the patience to explain
                the problem to me until I got what he was talking about).

                </li>
                <li><p>
                Stefan Lang for pointing out problems in the dark corners of the <a
                href="../../../classes/Rake/FileList.html">FileList</a> implementation.
                </p>

                Alexey Verkhovsky pointing out the silently swallows syntax errors in
                tests.

                </li>
                <li><p>
                Tobias Luetke for beautifying the test task output.
